    Welcome to my home of friendly and fostered code. Here you will find an assortment of projects and works that I've invested my time and energy into. These include school projects, open source pieces, and professional development pieces.

    <p>
    I'm a life long learner who was born and adopted from South Korea. I was welcomed into a lovely little family in Vermont and yes, I do love my maple syrup. I have a passion for coding that has been fostered by constant challenge and curiosity. I love the imagination and harvesting it's fullest potential through code. I am a super social penguin(spirit animal) and love to meet and discuss any of my code with you!
